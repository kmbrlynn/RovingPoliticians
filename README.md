RovingPoliticians
=================

"Roving Politicians" is an interactive installation, and my foray into physical computing. In the performance, two small battery-operated vehicles (politicians) rove freely in space until their infrared sensors detect roadblocks within a foot. When one politician sees a roadblock, it flashes "Go Left" in blue, backs up, turns left, and continues on its way. When the other politician sees a roadblock, it flashes "Go Right" in red, and turns right. Not surprisingly, these two "politicians" never get very far. The installation is a comment on how knee-jerk, partisan solutions to tough problems prevent progress. Programmed with the Arduino physical computing environment; uses the Arduino Duemilanove microchip.
